to compile and execute, you can use scripts provided here for both windows and linux

to execute on windows, you need to have LLVM Clang compiler and maybe MSVC (VisualStudio)
also this script apperently will only execute in CommandPrompt, not in PowerShell because of windows security restrictions...

to execute on linux, you need to have gcc compiler on your machine.
